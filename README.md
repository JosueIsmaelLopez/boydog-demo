## BoyDog monitor

BoyDog automatically creates a route to monitor all changes users make. Browse the *boydog-monitor* at the URL provided in the console log when you run `npm start`. This allows you to monitor user's input real-time. It has admin privileges and changes made through this page will be sent to connected users.

## Contributing

There are 3 main repositories:

 - [boydog](https://github.com/boydoglabs/boydog): The server module, handles OT, auth, and creates the boydog-monitor.
 - [boydog-client](https://github.com/boydoglabs/boydog-client): The client module, handles OT for the users, is in charge of updating HTML elements with the latest value from the server.
- boydog-demo (this repository): A demo showcasing all BoyDog capabilities. This is what you see  at [boy.dog](http://www.boy.dog). For simplicity all development is also made here, therefore if you want to start a new project **or** develop a new feature just clone this repository.

And a shareDB plugin:

 - [sharedb-attribute-binding](https://github.com/adelriosantiago/sharedb-attribute-binding): A custom-made ShareDB binding that allows you to sync element attributes like id, class, href, etc.

All these modules can be found inside the "git_modules" of this repo. To help you do changes easily do `npm run dev` to install these modules and automatically restart server on file changes.

## Running tests

First run the server with `npm start` or `npm run dev` if you are developing a new feature. Then run e2e tests with `npm run test`.
